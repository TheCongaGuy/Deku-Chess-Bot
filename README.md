# Chess Bot
Named after The Great Deku Tree in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, this is a chess AI implemented with a single goal in mind: Allow the chess AI to view as much of its search tree as possible. Because of this however, Deku can definitely take its time, but it shows in preformance. At a 1 minute search it can go toe to toe with stockfish, though fails to beat it. I am still proud of this AI none the less, and it certainly plays better than me, thought that isn't saying much. :sweat_smile: 

As of March 25, 2023 this is the most complex program I've made on my own. I had to use everything I learned in University to get the preformance I was seeking, and even then I had to reference old High School notes on minimax, and do additional research on breadth first search in recursion. I am sure there are things to improve with ol' Deku, but this was an amazing learning experience.

I am writing two versions of Deku; One written for Windows using Visual Studio 2022, and another written for Linux using Visual Studio Code, GNU C/C++ Compiler, and made in a Linux-Cinnamon Virtual Machine. Specific details of each implementation can be found in their respective folders for the curious.
